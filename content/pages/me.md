Iâ€™m Ihwan,  software developer, technical writer, and learner from Majalengka. I currently work as a mobile developer for [IndoSystem](https://www.indosystem.com/), and I've also written for [Mediyn](https://www.medium.com/@IhwanID).

I started this website as a place to document everything I learned while going through a [career change](https://www.ihwan.id/how-i-made-a-career-change-into-software-development/). I [learn in public](/learn) and write about everything I know. The free resources I create help thousands of people successfully become developers, too!
